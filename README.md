# Discord Game Bot - Gatcha System

> A little Discord bot to pimp your server with a dinosaur trading and gambling system
---

### About this project
This is a discord bot, that I have created in python when I was 16/17. I'm not sure if it works anymore, but you can go ahead and try it out.
If it is set up, every member on your server can type /daily to get some coins, which can then be used to gamble for dinosaurs, with which you can then fight with.
Have fun using it!
